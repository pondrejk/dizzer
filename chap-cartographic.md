  *This chapter examines the propeties of Big Data from the point of view of cartographic tradition, theory, and practice. We will focus on challenges that these properies pose to cartographic visualization, as well as on the knowledge cartography can offer to wider data-related practice*



## Wood and Eco
-- 10 cartographic codes -- intrasignification / extrasiginification
-- content / expression pane
-- focus on intrasignification codes (iconic, linguistic, tectonic, temporal (tense & durative) presentational) and how BD properties can be translated to those codes.
-- for some theoretical part think of signification levels -- elemental, systemic, syntehtic (!!! -- draw on this: "map sign systems talk to each other"), presentational

#More notes from @wood2010rethinking:
Intrasignification codes:

* Iconicity -- signs: plan information vs plan-free information -- "continuum between and beyond" these (to which extent is sign dependent on a real extent of phenomenon)
-- plan free is "disengaged from direct spatial correspondence"
* Linguistic -- map text -- "not also naming but also illuminating" (in sense of medeival illuminations?)
-- text has also iconic parameters (size for importance etc.)
* Tectonic -- map projections
-- does not produce material imagery, only apparent through iconic signs,
-- provides "syntactic superstructure for iconic code"
* Temporal -- 2 subcodes: tense -- temporal topology, duration -- temporal scale. Duration can be thick or thin -- my note: how about measuring it by the number of events per time unit?
* Presentational -- margin√°lie "perimap"

Levels of signification: (interpreted by the reader simultaneously, not in sequence):
* elemental -- not meaningfully-separable elements, functional vs. sign construct interpretations
* syntactic -- elemental signs in geographical context, structuring the space, percievable as a whole but despite the variety in signs -- e.g. road map
* synthetic -- sign systems talk to each other, each sign system can be a figure ar a ground at a same time
* presentational

Some direct quotes:

Formalist approach -- Klee, Kandinski, Dondis (A primer on visual latency), Wong (Principles of two dimensional design) and Bertin. Klee sees medial and active conditions of a same image plane (woods example lake plane and border). Woods alternative *sign-construct* -- lake consists of lake shoreline (a border between two qualities) and lake surface.

Hidden critique of Bertin? "Map signs have to be considered in terms of both expression and content. Formalist postures that regard inly signifiers but not signs don't cut it, since our conceptualizations of phenomena structure, even dictate, the manner in which we discourse about them" -- signifier vs sign?

When reading a map "we attend more to the syntax of the system than to to the semantic import of its components" -- my note: good for big data as individual components often make no sense and there is plenty of it.

"We distinguish blue highways highways from rivers nit because their signifiers are a little wider and a little less sinuous, but because they are striuctured differently sd systms, because htey are manifestly different landcapes" -- my note: what about perceiving the thematic overlay that is not rooted in the real world?

"Maps are about relationships. In other words, they are about how one landscape (...) is positioned in realation to another. The map synthetizes these diverse diverse landscapes, projecting them onto and indto one another, eith less than a subtle hints that one is correlative to anotheror that *this* is an agent or effect of *that*."

"There is nothing in the map that fails to signify."
