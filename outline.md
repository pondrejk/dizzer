# Introduction

# Defining Big Data
- Ontological characteristics
- Other ways of understanding big data
  - Vs and keywords
  - A challenge for technical infrastructure
  - Showing example sources and quantities
  - Metaphoric accounts
  - Holistic accouts
- Spatial big data 
- Assessing impacts, threats and opportunities

# Making sense of Big Data
- Spatial big data classification: stations, events, and agents
- Spatio-temporal knowledge discovery and visual analytics 
  - Spatio-temporal relations 
  - From data mining to visualisation for human interpretaton 
- The role of cartography
  - Map reading and interpretation
  - What next? Research challenges
  - How next? Challenges in collaborative practice
- Objections
  - Misinterpretation
  - Non-human decision makers


# Dealing with volume: (exhaustivity, indexicality, scalability, extensionality)
- avoiding aggregation (data vs visual aggregation)
- study of hexbin aggregation
- optionally: dimensionality reduction, autoencoders for spatial data
- an aside on UX, dealing with density in ux controls
- an aside on web graphics technologies, vector tiles and mapbox
- a discussion of figure vs groud
- Case study - urban recommendation system
-- inset map: https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/example-react-control

# Dealing with velocity:
- time depictions in cartography
- an aside on UX, using interaction and feedback in ux controls
- Case study - traffic trough the pandemic

# Future trajectories:
- ideas form sw testing in cartography, visual testing neeeded
- mocking data, preparing fake data with right properties for systems prototyping
- ML - first to take on manual tasks, then for map design related tasks?

# Discussion & Conclusion

# Appendices

- Case study outlines:
-- data sources and transformations
-- app architecture (react redux mapbox)
-- user interface design
-- interesting findings 
-- possible extensions
