# Introduction

The motivation for writing this thesis stems from the author's long time interest in cartographic visualisation in digital environments coupled with his practical experience with design and development of map-based web applications.

We recognize three main shifts that stared to alter how digital maps are produced, disseminated and interacted with. We believe that these tendencies will continue to have a growing influence and will gradually transfer digital mapmaking into new realities. Scientists and practitioners in fields of Cartography and Geoinformatics should not overlook these trends, to maintain the future relevance of these fields. At the same time, Cartography and Geoinformatics are uniquely positioned to take part in these efforts to work towards greater spatial enablement of general society. 

The mentioned shifts are threefold:

1. Changes in the characteristics of mapped data 
2. Changes in how maps are distributed over the network
3. Changes in how maps are rendered for users

These topics are reflected in the structure of the thesis. 

*Changes in the characteristics of mapped data that can be mapped* refer to the onset of big data sets. Chapter 1 looks at the definition of big data and provides a thorough literature review of various ways how this concept is understood. Special consideration is given to the notion of spatial big data and the related works from the spatial fields.

Chapter 2 further considers spatial big data from the point of analysis. The possible role of Cartography are also discussed, be it in fulfilling big data related research agendas, developing user engagement with applications or in facilitating collaboration in greater teams.

The topic of spatial big data extends also to Chapter 3. Here we discuss how the defining properties of big data translate to cartographic challenges of high spatial and temporal density, and how we can address them within the design constraints of digital mapping environments. We look more closely on the method of hexagonal aggregation and its advantages in addressing the spatial density of big data sets. The issue of user interactions with digital maps are also discussed.    

*Changes in how maps are distributed over the network* refer to the growing adoption of the vector tile exchange format. In Chapter 3 we discuss the specifics of the format compared to raster tiles. We describe the technical specifics of vector tile creation, dissemination, rendering and styling. 

*Changes in how maps are rendered for users* is closely connected to the capabilities of WebGL rendering environments. In Chapter 3 we thoroughly discuss how the combination of WebGL and vector tiles enables new options of cartographic visualisation as well as new modes of interaction for users.

The potential and limitations of transforming spatial big data into vector tiles for visualisation in WebGL-based environments are exemplified in two case studies in Chapters 4 and 5.

Chapter 4 describes the design and development of an urban recommendation system for the city of Brno. This prototype application shows the potential of dynamic visualisation based on hexagonal grid. Two modes of cartographic visualisation are showcased and evaluated.

Chapter 5 describes an application for viewing traffic patterns in the city of Brno during the eight weeks of the spring lockdown.

The thesis concludes in our outlook for the future developments in spatial data processing and visualisation.
