Some Impacts of Data Abundance
-------------------------

*This chapter explores some impacts of big data deluge, tracks discussion and controversies from standpoints of science, business, and society. The possible role of (cartographic) visialisation in tackling these issues is also considered*

# Post-theory and hypothesis-less science?
# Correlation is enough?
# Ethic/Legal/... Remedies. Towards big data literacy (data-awareness)
# Data to Spatial to Visual (= cartography) for tackling complexity

## Science

-- data science, post theory

More on *value* -- the potential market value is potentially huge ("The potential value of Big Data is huge. Speaking about new Big Data initiatives in the US healthcare system last year, McKinsey estimated if these initiatives were rolled out system-wide, they “could account for $300 billion to $450 billion in reduced health-care spending, or 12 to 17 percent of the $2.6 trillion baseline in US health-care costs”. However, the cost of poor data is also huge- it’s estimated to cost US businesses $3.1 trillion a year. In essence, data on its own is virtually worthless. The value lies in rigorous analysis of accurate data, and the information and insights this provides." says @mcnulty2014understanding link on McKinsey <http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/the-big-data-revolution-in-us-health-care>), but it "has the potential to cost unlimited amounts of money" @fischer2015why.


## Business

-- where the hype (and bullshit comes form)
-- @marr2014big -- plenty of use cases from bussiness -- try to classify somehow? (not too much)

-- the question of maturity -- gartner's graph of technologies -- pozri diplomka (nejaká aktuálnejšia verzia?). -- search gartner hype cycle

## Society

-- some usual concerns
-- how to mitigate by lowering exhaustivity calling cognitive limits for the help

@florescu2012will -- posibility to extend official statistics with BD also kitchin2015opportunities

TODO -- use notes from file chap-philosophy of big data

## The improtance of visualization

-- vis for humans, machines do not need it (?) -- move to a different chapter
-- here just the societal responsibility of designers (first things first movement?, something for data visualists), and cartographers (harley, wood, crampton, -- radical cartography (Paglen?))

## more technical -- move somewhere else
* check later when you undestand it better :)
-- meta-data specifications for BD -- ask Radim & Tomas
-- ogc standard? -- refreshable wms? :P

## risks

-- abuse at amazon -- @head2014worse
-- the world needs fixing, not disrupting: in <https://deardesignstudent.com/8-reasons-to-turn-down-that-startup-job-1f82a00ade34>

data creation in facilites:
-- cern obviously
-- https://www.lsst.org/ telescope in chile
-- companies providing acessing productivity in places like distribution centers @lewitt2016more
-- smart homes?

or more topic-based structure? from promise and peril
