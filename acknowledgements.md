**Acknowledgements & dedication**

First of all I would like to thank my supervisor Mgr. Karel StanÄ›k, Ph.D. for his advice, insights and a great deal of patience. Many thanks go to all lecturers, colleagues and friends that helped me during my time at the Department of Geography of Masaryk University. Last but not least I would like to thank Mapbox, Inc. and the Mapbox Community team for generously providing data samples for one of the case studies.

I dedicate this work to my family for their love, support and encouragement.
